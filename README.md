## üìÇ **My Notable Repositories**  
Here are some repositories that showcase my projects and contributions:

### 1. **[Color Picker App](https://github.com/North-Abyss/Color-Picker-App-KSY)**  
A color detection tool that allows users to upload an image, click on any point, and see the closest matching color‚Äôs name and its RGB values.

### 2. **[Pixel Art RPG Game](https://github.com/North-Abyss/Pixel-Art-RPG-Game)**  
A 2D RPG game where I experiment with tile-based systems, and RPG mechanics using Java. Features include a custom battle system and tile-based map.

### 3. **[Abyss: RPG Adventure](https://github.com/North-Abyss/Abyss-RPG-Game)**  
An ongoing RPG project blending adventure, strategy, and exploration, designed with a custom tile-based system. The project includes developing quest systems, enemy AI, and character progression.

### 4. **[Game Optimizer](https://github.com/North-Abyss/Game-Optimizer)**  
A tool I created to analyze game performance for mobile games, providing suggestions for optimization in graphics, memory usage, and asset management.

### 5. **[Groundwater Conservation Education Platform](https://github.com/North-Abyss/Groundwater-Platform)**  
A platform that educates users about groundwater conservation. I‚Äôve built it using React and integrated educational tools.
